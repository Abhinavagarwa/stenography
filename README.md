# stenography
this is Abhinav Agarwal we have made a Stenography detection from a ML model with considering three models
 > Random Forest Accuracy: 0.39 <br>
 > XGBoost Accuracy: 0.39 <br>
 > LightGBM Accuracy: 0.39 <br>
and stacked them together to achieve Ensemble Accuracy: 0.38
this accuracy cannot be increased as the machine limitations so we are sticking to this only
and also we are other models if there will be anything we will be telling you
